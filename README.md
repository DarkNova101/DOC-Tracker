- Talk to mom about storing info in Mysql doc form with JSON
  - Username, FullName, pass, email, and ID save in table.
    - Rest of into pushed into a JSON and file name saved in MYSQL TABLE?
    - Pull up JSON data info web browser when searching for a user

Example [OLD]
    - [ID] [email]         [Full Name]    [username] [password]          [JSON FILE]
    - [1]  [test@test.com] [Test E Test]  [test]     [ENCRYPTED/HASHED]  [TestETest.json]or[Test E Test.json]


2 Bookmarks in Google Chrome about this. Make a file per person that can be edited whenever with JSON stuff and looked up and printed with PHP.


- Start Work on Set Personal Information Page (setdetails.php) example found here (https://securesite.ministrytracker.com/edit_student.cgi?STID=2028892) [OLD SEEL BELOW]
- Work on index page more, similar to (https://securesite.ministrytracker.com/og_profile.cgi)? (account.php)

- Add Events Calendar (Calendar.php)
- Work on About & Contact Page (contact.php) & (about.php)


Priority:
 1) Work on Set Personal Information
 2) Setup JSON Storage // Look into doing all registration on one page and encoding the JSON file while registering? Might make process easier // Would need to look how to edit JSON file after its made for changing profile settings
 3) Index Page to show minimal info on Person (https://gyazo.com/e59d9e499830fbef1447a132303f36d0)
